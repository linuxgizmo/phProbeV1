I wrote this file to process a PH probe that I am setting up for monitoring using a Raspberry Pi.  The file polls the temperature sensor and PH probe, takes their inputs, applies temperature correction, and outputs the value in a variable.  I wrote this for intergration with the Home Assistant program, but there shouldn't be any reason why the script won't work the same for any program able to execute python scripts and then work with the variables reported.
